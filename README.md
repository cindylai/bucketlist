As a final project for 67-328, Mobile to Cloud: Building Distributed Applications, I made a an application that creates 'bucketlists' of what users what to do in a specified city. The user would use the system to search for a specific destination and choosing a category of food, arts & recreation, or night life. The user will see a list of potential venues that is generated using the FourSquare API. The user can click on each venue name to see more information and if it is a place the user would like to visit, they can press the 'favorite' button. The user can view all favorited venues by clicking on the 'Favorited Venues' button. 

This application is deployed at http://bucketlist-cindylai.rhcloud.com/.

In the future, there is potential change to incorporate markers on the google map and to implement authentication and authorization.
